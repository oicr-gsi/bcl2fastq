# bcl2fastq

This [SeqWare](http://seqware.github.io/) workflow transforms Illumina base calls from sequencer run directories into paired-end fastq.gz files and log files using [bcl2fastq](http://support.illumina.com/downloads/bcl2fastq_conversion_software_184.html). The "CASAVA" name is a misnomer since bcl2fastq is used exclusively, but is maintained for historical purposes.

##Workflow

The source code for the [bcl2fastq SeqWare workflow](workflow-casava) is freely available from github at https://github.com/oicr-gsi .

###Decider

The decider can be launched using the [bcl2fastq SeqWare decider](decider-bcl2fastq).

##Support
For support, please file an issue on the [Github project](https://github.com/oicr-gsi) or send an email to gsi@oicr.on.ca .
