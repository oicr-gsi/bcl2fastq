## BCL2FastQ Decider

Version 1.3

### Overview

This decider launches the [BCL2FastQ (AKA Casava) Workflow](../workflow-casava) to demultiplex and convert BCL files from an Illumina sequencer run to FASTQ format.

The decider operates as follows:
- retrieves all lanes that are available from the sample and lane provenance providers (specified in the provenance settings file)
- retrieves all lanes that have associated analysis from the analysis provenance providers (specified in the provenance settings file)
- calculates the difference between the above two lane name sets to determine the set of lanes that have not be analyzed
- creates a SeqWare IUS-LimsKey (a SeqWare object that is used to link LIMS data from provenance providers such as Pinery and SeqWare to SeqWare workflow runs) for each lane and a SeqWare IUS-LimsKey for each sample in the associated lane
- schedules a separate SeqWare workflow run for each lane and links the workflow run to the appropriate SeqWare IUS-LimsKey(s)

### Compile

```
mvn clean install
```

```
